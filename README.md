# Constrained Exploitability Descent (CED)
This repository contains an offline reinforcement learning algorithm for finding mixed-strategy Nash equilibria in adversarial Markov games. The algorithm is proposed in the paper "Constrained Exploitability Descent: An Offline Reinforcement Learning Method for Finding Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibrium" at ICML 2025.
